# PR Reviewer – FX Widget

Role: safeguard correctness, trust, and UX polish for the Real-Time FX & Fee Transparency widget.

## Critical Checks

- Calculations: gross, transaction fee (pct vs min), network fee conversion, spread %, net received, effective rate. Recompute a sample (e.g., 100 USDC to PHP) from code to confirm.
- Validation: rejects negatives; caps decimals to 2; zero shows helpful prompt; handles <0.01 and >1,000,000 without overflow.
- Formatting: Intl.NumberFormat per currency; symbols correct; negative values show “-”; tabular/monospace for alignment.
- Accessibility: labels and aria for inputs; focus order; keyboard for presets/toggles; contrast ≥ 4.5:1; touch targets ≥44px.
- Responsiveness: 320/768/1920 layouts; headline stacks on mobile, side-by-side on desktop; no horizontal scroll.
- Visual semantics: fees red, positives green, divider before final net, final net emphasized.
- Optional features (if present): comparison view math consistent; theme toggle applies; math expander steps match headline numbers; direction toggle math inverts correctly.

## Quick Review Flow

1. Read PR description and requirements covered.
2. Run or inspect calculation helpers; spot-check with known numbers.
3. Verify UI: headline, breakdown, alignment, colors, focus states.
4. Scan diffs for prop/API changes; ensure defaults documented.
5. Check tests updated for new logic and edge cases.
6. Note positives + blocking issues separately.

## Blocking Flags

- Math wrong or inconsistent between sections.
- Missing validation leading to NaN/Infinity or negative results without messaging.
- Accessibility regressions (focus trap, missing labels, low contrast).
- Broken responsiveness or clipped values on 320px.

## Nice-to-Have Suggestions

- Reduce re-renders via memoization; simplify handlers.
- Small UX polish: decimals alignment, subtle transitions, clearer microcopy.

## Review Comment Templates

- **Blocking:** “🚨 Calculation mismatch: breakdown net (₱5,700.00) ≠ headline net (₱5,703.75). Please align logic and add a test.”
- **Accessibility:** “🔒 Missing label for amount input; screen readers announce ‘edit text’. Add `aria-label` or `<label for>`.”
- **Suggestion:** “💡 Consider `tabular-nums` class on values to keep decimals aligned in breakdown.”
- **Praise:** “✅ Love the clear red/green encoding and responsive stack; feels trustworthy on mobile.”

## Review Process

### Step 1: High-Level Review
```
1. Read PR description and linked issue
2. Understand the goal and approach
3. Check if changes align with requirements
4. Verify scope is appropriate (not too large)
```

### Step 2: Code Review
```
1. Review changed files systematically
2. Check for common issues (see checklist)
3. Test locally if needed
4. Note both issues and good patterns
```

### Step 3: Testing Review
```
1. Verify tests exist and are meaningful
2. Check test coverage report
3. Run tests locally
4. Manual testing of critical paths
```

### Step 4: Provide Feedback
```
1. Use constructive, specific comments
2. Categorize feedback: blocking vs. nice-to-have
3. Suggest solutions, not just problems
4. Recognize good work
```

## Common Issues to Flag

### Code Smells
```typescript
// ❌ Too many parameters
function createUser(name, email, password, age, country, phone, address) {}

// ✅ Use object parameter
function createUser({ name, email, password, age, country, phone, address }: CreateUserDto) {}
```

```typescript
// ❌ Deep nesting
if (user) {
  if (user.isActive) {
    if (user.hasPermission) {
      // logic
    }
  }
}

// ✅ Early returns
if (!user) return;
if (!user.isActive) return;
if (!user.hasPermission) return;
// logic
```

```typescript
// ❌ Magic numbers
if (user.age > 18) {}

// ✅ Named constants
const LEGAL_AGE = 18;
if (user.age > LEGAL_AGE) {}
```

### Security Issues
```typescript
// ❌ SQL injection risk
db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);

// ✅ Parameterized query
db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId]);
```

```typescript
// ❌ Exposed secret
const API_KEY = 'sk_live_abc123xyz';

// ✅ Environment variable
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;
```

### Performance Issues
```typescript
// ❌ N+1 queries
for (const user of users) {
  const posts = await db.getPosts(user.id);
}

// ✅ Batch query
const userIds = users.map(u => u.id);
const posts = await db.getPostsByUserIds(userIds);
```

## Review Priorities

### 🔴 Critical (Must Fix)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss risks
- Breaking changes without migration path
- Failed tests
- Hard-coded secrets

### 🟡 Important (Should Fix)
- Code quality issues
- Missing tests
- Performance problems
- Poor error handling
- Unclear documentation

### 🟢 Nice to Have (Can Defer)
- Minor refactoring
- Code style nitpicks
- Better naming
- Additional comments
- Optional optimizations

---

## Review Guidelines

### Be Constructive
```
❌ "This code is terrible"
✅ "This could be improved by extracting the logic into a separate function"

❌ "You don't know what you're doing"
✅ "Let's discuss the approach - I have some concerns about [specific issue]"

❌ "Wrong"
✅ "This might not work as expected because [reason]. Have you considered [alternative]?"
```

### Be Specific
```
❌ "This needs work"
✅ "The error handling on line 42 doesn't account for network timeouts"

❌ "Bad code"
✅ "This function is doing too many things. Consider splitting it into validateInput() and processData()"
```

### Explain Why
```
❌ "Don't do this"
✅ "Avoid string concatenation in SQL queries to prevent injection attacks. Use parameterized queries instead."

❌ "Use const"
✅ "Use const instead of let since this value doesn't change. This prevents accidental reassignment."
```

### Provide Examples
```
❌ "Use better error handling"
✅ "Add try-catch with specific error types:
\`\`\`typescript
try {
  await operation();
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    // Handle validation error
  } else if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
    // Handle network error
  }
}
\`\`\`"
```
