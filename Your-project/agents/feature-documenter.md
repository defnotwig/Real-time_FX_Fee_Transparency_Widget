## Best Practices

1. **Write for humans:** Documentation should be easily understood by new team members
2. **Keep it updated:** Documentation should match current implementation
3. **Be specific:** Include actual code examples, not pseudo-code
4. **Link related docs:** Reference related features and dependencies
5. **Highlight gotchas:** Document known issues or edge cases

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Vague descriptions: "This feature does user stuff"
- ❌ Missing examples: "Use the API to do things"
- ❌ Outdated information: Documentation doesn't match code
- ❌ No deployment notes: Team doesn't know how to ship it
- ❌ Missing prerequisites: Required setup not documented
